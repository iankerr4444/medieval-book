# Transcribing Medieval Documents

(Lightly adapted from the rules suggested in Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham. [Introduction to Manuscript Studies](http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100177870). Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2007.

The purpose of a transcription is to provide an accurate record of the manuscript  . The transcriber, therefore, should resist the temptation to normalize and thus should reproduce the peculiarities of spelling and even outright errors. Maintain original spelling and punctuation as much as possible, but a transcription is not a fascimile. 

## Major Rules:

1. Start a new numbered line in the transcription for every new line in the manuscript, or, use a slash (/) to show line breaks. 
2. Use capitals where the manuscript uses capitals, even if it differs from modern usage. Personal names in the Middle Ages were not capitalized, and so do not do so in your transcription. 
3. Use the forms of punctuation that occur in the manuscript. Do not attempt to translate them into modern punctuation. 
4. Do not normalize spelling. The same word might be spelled different ways - retain original spelling even if a clear mistake. 
5. Normalize word separation. If two words are run together in the manuscript, with no space between them, the transcription should show two separate words.
6. Expand abbreviations. 
7. Record the beginning of a new page in the manuscript by entering the folio number within square brackets at the appropriate point in the transcription. Also record a column letter within square brackers (eg. a, b or c) at the beginning of a new column. 

| **symbol** | **description** | **use** | **example** |
|---|---|---|---|
| ( ) | Parentheses | Expanded abbreviation | d(omi)ni 
| † † |	obeli or daggers	| problematic readings: text is corrupt, or transcriber is uncertain of the text | †domini† |
| / \ |	slashes	| scribal insertion on the line | do/mi\ni |
| \ /	| slashes |	scribal insertion between lines | do\mi/ni |
| \\\ //	| double slashes |	scribal insertion in the margin | \\\domini//
| [ ]	| square brackets	| letters canceled by scraping or washing; legible erased letters are placed within the brackets | do[mi]ni |
| [ / ]	| square brackets and slash	| substitution of a new letter or word over an erasure; if original reading is legible, it is placed to the left of slash | [/d]omini *or* [h/d]omini | 
| `[[ ]]`	| double square brackets |	portion of text lost through damage (trimming of the margin, rodent activity, etc.) | domin`[[*]]` with asterisks indicating the estimated number of letters lost |
